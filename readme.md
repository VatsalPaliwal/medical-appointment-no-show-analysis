Executive Summary

Missed medical appointments create real operational problems — wasted slots, longer wait times, and increased pressure on staff. In this project, we looked at scheduling, communication, patient, and location-related factors to understand why no-shows happen and what can realistically be done to reduce them. The results show that missed appointments are driven mostly by how appointments are scheduled, rather than who the patient is. While it is possible to identify higher-risk appointments in advance, the biggest gains come from improving processes rather than relying solely on prediction.

What Drives Appointment No-Shows

Waiting Period (Primary Driver)
The time between booking an appointment and the actual visit plays the biggest role in whether patients show up. As this waiting period increases, the likelihood of a no-show rises steadily. This pattern appears consistently across different patient groups and locations, making waiting time the most important factor to address.

SMS Reminders (Secondary Driver)
SMS reminders help reduce no-shows, especially when appointments are scheduled far in advance. However, reminders alone cannot fully compensate for long delays. In practice, SMS works best as a support mechanism rather than a standalone fix.

Neighbourhood (Contextual Factor)
No-show rates vary across neighbourhoods, suggesting that local factors such as accessibility or daily constraints may influence attendance. These differences are useful for prioritizing outreach efforts, but they should not be interpreted as individual-level causes.

What Does Not Drive No-Shows

Patient characteristics such as age, gender, and recorded medical conditions showed little impact on whether appointments were missed. Financial assistance indicators and disability markers also did not meaningfully change attendance patterns in this dataset. Overall, this suggests that no-shows are influenced more by system-level factors than by individual patient profiles.

Can No-Shows Be Anticipated in Advance?

Using existing data, it is possible to identify appointments that carry a higher risk of no-show. However, many missed appointments are still driven by last-minute or unobserved factors that cannot be captured in the data. As a result, prediction should be viewed as a tool to support decision-making, not as a fully automated solution.

Practical Recommendations

Reduce Long Waiting Periods Where Possible
Shortening the time between booking and appointment is likely to have the biggest impact on attendance.

Use SMS Reminders Strategically
Focus reminder efforts on appointments with longer waiting periods, where they are most effective.

Use Better Reminder Methods in High-Risk Patients
It was observed that in high risk patients sending an sms reminder was not enough for them to not miss the apppoointments,To increase their attendance new reminder methods like call should be set-up

Target High-Risk Areas Thoughtfully
Neighbourhood-level patterns can help prioritize additional reminders or outreach, without making assumptions about individual patients.

Focus on Process Improvements First
Given current data limitations, operational changes are likely to deliver better results than building complex automated systems.

Limitations & Next Steps

This analysis does not capture several factors that may influence attendance, such as transportation availability, work schedules, prior attendance history, or reminder timing. Including these elements in future data collection could improve both understanding and decision-making. Until then, a measured, process-focused approach is recommended.
